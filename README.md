# neural-net-js
A Javascript neural network ported from Michael Nielsen's python code examples

An attempt to rewrite the made-from-scratch Python neural networks created by Michael Nielsen in his book http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/. 

The file `tests/network-test.js` does successfully train some data to output a fixed number, but this is not very useful. To try this out, run node `tests/network-test.js` within the root of the project.

This is a work in progress.
